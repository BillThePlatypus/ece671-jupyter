    "# Introduction \n",
    "In linear algebra, a QR factorization of a matrix is a factorization of a matrix A into a product $A = QR$ of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. QR factorization is often used to solve the linear least squares problem and is the basis for a particular eigenvalue algorithm, the QR algorithm.\n",
    "One of the key benefits of using QR factorization over other methods for solving linear least squares is that it is more numerically stable, albeit at the expense of being slower to execute. Hence if we are performing a large quantity of regressions as part of a trading backtest, for instance, we need to consider very extensively whether QR factorization is the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a square matrix A the QR factorization converts A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q (i.e. $QTQ=I$) and an upper triangular matrix R. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A=QR$\n",
    "The first step is to create the vector x, which is the k-th column of the matrix A, for step k. We define $α=−sgn(xk)(||x||)$. The norm $||⋅||$ used here is the Euclidean norm. Given the first column vector of the identity matrix, I of equal size to A, $e1=(1,0,...,0)T$, we create the vector u:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u=x+αe1$\n",
    "Once we have the vector u, we need to convert it to a unit vector, which we denote as v:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v=u/||u||$\n",
    "Now we form the matrix Q out of the identity matrix I and the vector multiplication of v:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q=I−2vvT$\n",
    "Q is now an m×m Householder matrix, with $Qx=(α,0,...,0)T$. We will use Q to transform A to upper triangular form, giving us the matrix R. We denote Q as Qk and, since k=1 in this first step, we have Q1 as our first Householder matrix. \n",
    "Hence, we define Qk as the block matrix $Q_{k}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "I_{k-1} & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & Q_{k}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{k}=(I_{k}−100Q′_{k})$\n",
    "Once we have carried out t iterations of this process we have R as an upper triangular matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R=Q_{t}...Q_{2}Q_{1}A$\n",
    "Q is then fully defined as the multiplication of the transposes of each Qk:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q=Q^{T}_{1}Q^{T}_{2}...Q^{T}_{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives $A=QR$, the QR factorization of A."

    "Even though QR factorization can be used to solve a system of Linear Equations and is in fact better than Gaussian Elimination in terms of stability, it is rarely used for the same because of its cost of computation being twice that of Gaussian elimination.\n",
    "Another important use of QR factorization is inspiring the QR algorithm for calculation of eigen value factorization."

    "The result of the python generated code and the SciPy code should be same for the accurate python code. I got the same result for the python code and SciPy. This code is valid only both for the Python2 and Python3. It may show some error in python3 because python3 prefers range instead of xrange command. xrange need to be change in range for python3 which is a valid command to avoid any kind of error. "
